## 5. Known Bugs and Limitations

Here are some known bugs:

* We use the OpenStreetMap open API, so if you can't access it and the console displays the error TIME OUT, it's mostly
  because you've reached the access limit.
  After all, it is free and open source.
* It might not work on some people's computers.
  After many debugging attempts, it's very likely a default root directory
  issue.
  Since we couldn't use filepath or similar methods, such issues might occur frequently.
  Try switching to a
  different IDE Live or adjusting the startup parameters to see if that helps.
* When you update your profile, it will go to main page automatically, but cannot load it.
* If there are any unknown issues, please post them in
  the [issues](https://github.com/JackHuynhLe/1800_202410_BBY26/issues) section, or just fix it
  and [request a pull](https://github.com/JackHuynhLe/1800_202410_BBY26/pulls); unless something unexpected happens, we
  probably won't try to fix it.
